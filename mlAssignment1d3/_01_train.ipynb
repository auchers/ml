       "      <td>Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not \"goopy\" nor does it leave \"rice-sludge\" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.&lt;br /&gt;We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.&lt;br /&gt;We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-It contains DHA to boost development.&lt;br /&gt;-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.&lt;br /&gt;-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).&lt;br /&gt;-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</td>\n",

The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products.  The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth.  They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure.  These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results.  Following their diet plan of two meal replacement bars a day with three snack bars will more than likely increase weight loss from the few pounds I have lost eating one bar a day.</td>\n",

       "0    When this food came out, my cats went crazy the first time I brought it home.  My older cats had liked the ground or classic cat food but these cats wouldn't have anything to do with it.  I've been buying this food for over a year and novelty hasn't worn off yet and even the cat across the street comes over for some.  They love it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "121  This is a tasty product, unlike some of the gluten-free foods that I have tried.  It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts.  It has plenty of calories, but I use it as a topping for other, less-tasty cereals, e.g. bran flakes or some of the high-fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "195  Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not \"goopy\" nor does it leave \"rice-sludge\" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.   \n",
       "238  My 3 cats, including my youngest who doesn't like seafood (but loves to play in water!), LOVE these. I can't go to the cabinet without all 3 of them following me, meowing for these treats!<br /><br />And they're healthy because they're mostly air. So, my guys get this treat just about every evening. Buy them - Your cat(s) will love them, too. BTW, these were reviewed/tested by either Cat Fancy or Catnip magazine (where I first heard about them), and they got 5 stars because all of the test cats loved them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "407  I eat a high protein meal replacement bar every day for breakfast, and I have lost several pounds.  The bar is high in protein, which does keep you fuller longer.  By lunchtime I am usually pretty hungry, but I can hold out until lunchtime without a problem.  They are a bit dry, so I always have a drink on hand while eating them.  The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products.  The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth.  They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure.  These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.<br /><br />This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results.  Following their diet plan of two meal replacement bars a day with three snack bars will more than likely increase weight loss from the few pounds I have lost eating one bar a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
