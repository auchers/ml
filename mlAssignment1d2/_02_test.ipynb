I know, you are too young.  Whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always returned to my Trident Original. It tastes good, the flavor lasts, it's the right size.  But this is not Trident Original.  This is fancy pants Trident Vitality \"Awaken.\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trident lets you know it's fancy by excessively packaging it.  It's a lot of paper and plastic for 9 pieces of gum, so I dropped it a star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gum is nicely flavored.  I do like the texture aspect when biting into a crunchy outer coating, and getting into the soft center.  The flavor lasts a long, long time.  (I'm pretty sure that's another gum's motto - Hubba Bubba as it turns out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chewed for 45 minutes.  At first it's a pretty soft chew, but the gum firms up as time goes on.  By the time I was ready to spit it out, the flavor was still there but my jaw was sore.  I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a nice gum, but nothing I would throw over my Trident Original for, and the packaging would give me pause anyway.  Though, I will say that one benefit of the packaging means that it is impossible for the gum to fall out of the pack and get purse debris stuck to it, so that's a nice feature, but heck ... what's a little sand and tobacco stuck to your gum?  It gives it character.</td>\n",

Hint:If the price scares you just think of what you pay at a bakery for a simple birthday cake.&lt;br /&gt;J.Peterson, MN</td>\n",

I love the taste and the fact they're much lower in fat than \"regular\" chips. I eat the 3 ounce potato Popchips bags and now the 3.5 ounce Tortilla bags. These 3.5 oz bags seem to be just slightly less volume than the 3 oz potato bags but both are a satisfying amount. The nutritional values for the Tortilla bags are pretty much the same as the potato (not exact but close). So that said when I saw these brand new tortilla Popchips on Amazon I got excited! Excited over chips? Yes. I immediately ordered a box of the Nacho Cheese with subscription. Today they finally arrived and just in time for lunch. They nailed it! They look like any tortilla chip but a bit more puffy. They are crunchy but slightly more \"fluffy\" I guess you could say than a regular tortilla chip. The corn tortilla flavor is strong (tastes good) and the nacho cheese flavor tastes pretty much like you'd expect, very similar to nacho cheese Doritos (good!). Basically these taste like a very good tortilla chip or nacho cheese Dorito but without any greasy feeling or taste. I LOVE these, now I just need to try the other flavors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note... Boo Amazon dropping subscribe and save discount on Popchips to 5%...</td>\n",

However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice \"dances\" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.</td>\n",

       "0    A chance introduction to Savini Tartufi White Truffle oil has become one our delightful pasta experiences. A light dribble of oil, with a sliver of goat cheese, and our pasta is complete.<br />Heavenly!<br /><br />This Savini oil has the aroma and the finish of a great flavored oil, with the sophisticated delicacy to warrant the price.<br /><br />Other domestic oils finish so harshly as to be distasteful and disagreeable. Having experienced this oil, we know what good food may be experienced,<br /><br />We discovered this oil upon the learning our previous oil was no longer being imported. It too was wonderful, but our need to have a replacement, a superior truffle oil, sent us searching, and we found this Italian export through Amazon.com.<br /><br />For those enjoying truffles, I heartily recommend this oil for eggs, pasta, salads, where ever a premium oil would add a delicate note to the flavors of the dish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "16   I am a Trident Original gal.  Have been since my youth.  Oh sure, I strayed into Extra territory, and who can forget the \"Bubble Yum\" years?  (Red Dye Number 2 anyone?  I know, you are too young.  Whatever.)<br /><br />I always returned to my Trident Original. It tastes good, the flavor lasts, it's the right size.  But this is not Trident Original.  This is fancy pants Trident Vitality \"Awaken.\"<br /><br />Trident lets you know it's fancy by excessively packaging it.  It's a lot of paper and plastic for 9 pieces of gum, so I dropped it a star for that.<br /><br />The gum is nicely flavored.  I do like the texture aspect when biting into a crunchy outer coating, and getting into the soft center.  The flavor lasts a long, long time.  (I'm pretty sure that's another gum's motto - Hubba Bubba as it turns out.)<br /><br />I chewed for 45 minutes.  At first it's a pretty soft chew, but the gum firms up as time goes on.  By the time I was ready to spit it out, the flavor was still there but my jaw was sore.  I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere.<br /><br />It's a nice gum, but nothing I would throw over my Trident Original for, and the packaging would give me pause anyway.  Though, I will say that one benefit of the packaging means that it is impossible for the gum to fall out of the pack and get purse debris stuck to it, so that's a nice feature, but heck ... what's a little sand and tobacco stuck to your gum?  It gives it character.   \n",
       "32   I recently switched to protein supplements in an attempt to build lean muscle.  Whey protein worked well but left me feeling bloated.  I stumbled across this product while looking for an alternative, and it is fantastic! No bloating, no bog down, leaves me feeling fantastic.  The taste leaves something to be desired, but what can you expect?  It's raw, organic, and has no additives whatsoever, so protein is all you get.  Mix it with a bit of almond milk, almond butter, and a banana, and it's the best thing ever!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "48   Wow!  As an unrepentant chocoholic, I'm always looking for great yummy chocolate treats.  Unfortunately, there IS a downside: too much of a good thing can lead to less than desirable results, especially on the scale.<br /><br />Soooo ... I try to moderate my chocolate consumption, exercising portion control, etc.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Warm Delights since they were introduced - they're VERY good and easy to prepare -- but they're rather high in calories (and Weight Watchers points).<br /><br />These new Minis are the perfect solution:  150 calories (or 3 Weight Watchers points).

       "82   I started hearing about coconut water several years ago, but it generally struck me as dirty dish water when I would try to drink it. Then Zico came along. I've been a Zico convert now for about four months, and I can literally feel the difference this product makes in my body chemistry. There are indeed other coconut water products out there that are similar, but Zico hits the sweet spot with price, size, and quality of product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "100  I have lost considerable amount of weight with the Medifast system; however, their bars taste like cardboard to me.  These Thinkthin bars have a much more natural taste.  It both looks and tastes like something found in nature.  You can see the peanuts and dried fruit in them.  The Thinkthin bar even has less sugar than the medifast bars that I have paid double the price for.  Also, they taste better than Clif bars too.  And I continue to lose weight with the Thinkthin bar substitution.<br /><br />I like this product and now have purchased them a second time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "143  How happy I am to have found a mix that lives up to its name! The original Tunnel of Fudge bundt cake was a prize winning cake of the 70's and the very best chocolate cake ever, in my opinion. The dry frosting mix used in this recipe went obsolete in the 90's. Now, finally, my family can enjoy this lushous cake once more with Nordic Ware's cake mix. I bought one and tried it and the same wonderful taste came back to me. I have recommeded this taste sensation to all of my friends and bought 2 more for myself.

       "144  In the pre-Popchips days Doritos were one of my favorite chips... I eat chips every day with lunch, now I only eat Popchips. I love the taste and the fact they're much lower in fat than \"regular\" chips. I eat the 3 ounce potato Popchips bags and now the 3.5 ounce Tortilla bags. These 3.5 oz bags seem to be just slightly less volume than the 3 oz potato bags but both are a satisfying amount. The nutritional values for the Tortilla bags are pretty much the same as the potato (not exact but close). So that said when I saw these brand new tortilla Popchips on Amazon I got excited! Excited over chips? Yes. I immediately ordered a box of the Nacho Cheese with subscription. Today they finally arrived and just in time for lunch. They nailed it! They look like any tortilla chip but a bit more puffy. They are crunchy but slightly more \"fluffy\" I guess you could say than a regular tortilla chip. The corn tortilla flavor is strong (tastes good) and the nacho cheese flavor tastes pretty much like you'd expect, very similar to nacho cheese Doritos (good!). Basically these taste like a very good tortilla chip or nacho cheese Dorito but without any greasy feeling or taste. I LOVE these, now I just need to try the other flavors!<br /><br />Side note... Boo Amazon dropping subscribe and save discount on Popchips to 5%...                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "180  Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice \"dances\" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "187  Made this soup last night. It was sooo easy and yummy! I was not sure how much doctoring would be necessary to make it tasty for everyone and was surprised to find that it needed little help. I followed the directions on the bag and mixed with vegie stock/water (I had to add a lot more than listed!) and some of the basic vegies on hand - onions, garlic, carrot, celery - that was it! I tasted and it was delicious the way it was.(with salt and pepper to tase). I did not add milk to make the creamed version as I really liked the clean simple flavors of the mix. It was so easy, required no special ingredients or trip to the grocery store. Love it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "191  The Tully French Roast is the strongest, richest, most flavorful k-cup I have found (better than Timothy's Espresso, which is weaker).  This k-cup of coffee gets big compliments from all my guests- it's even strong enough to pour over ice for iced coffees.<br /><br />The price on this 108 ct when I bought it was the best I've seen by far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "203  I have used The Vegg for a variety of recipes.  It is not exactly like eggs but gives that egg flavoring.  You may have to use starch with some of the recipes for a thickening/binding effect.

       "222  I love this tea! Who ever thinks of it as cheap should really consider the complexity and the harmony of the flavors that come through with each cup. It may not be the prized white tea, but the nutty taste keeps you wanting more. It's a great part of my tea alternation. I go from something fruity to nutty interchangably. For my nutty trips I consider a cup of Genmai cha and Oolong and for the fruity I recommend a cup of Orange Blossom White Tea. Also try Japanese charry green.

       "284  I brought these at a local health food store since they were the only ones that weren't peanut butter or chocolate flavored, or didn't have several lines of \"extra\" ingredients in them. These are on the savory side of the flavor spectrum, if you like the sweeter granola/energy/fiber bars, these will be on the bland side. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste like they look - green. I found these were much more filling that traditional granola bars with less calories, fat, and additives. However, they are on the pricey side. I keep these handy in my car and purse to prevent hungry trips to fast food restaurants when time is short.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
